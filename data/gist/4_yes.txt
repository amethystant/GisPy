Should childhood vaccinations be mandatory?

For some vaccination proponents, the recent measles outbreak is proof positive the government should bust into the yurts of every Joe Moonbeam and Mary Windsong to immunize their children. But mandatory medical treatment, besides seeming a tad repressive, could lead to isolated communities and a rash of home schooling that might be as dangerous as disease in the long run. So what do we do? Some pundits suggested funding a vaccination for bad judgment. Of course, even if that happened, the wrong people would still refuse to get it.
