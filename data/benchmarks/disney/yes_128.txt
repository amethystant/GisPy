Measles vaccine benefits far outweigh risks

The recent measles outbreak in California has underscored the dangers of not vaccinating children. It’s an incredible risk for not only those kids, but also infants who are too young to be vaccinated.

In a sense, it’s amazing measles is again part of our national dialogue. There was a time — before vaccinations — when millions of Americans would contract measles each year and 400 to 500 of them would even die from the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But by 2000, the U.S. had achieved a remarkable public health feat: Measles was declared eliminated from this country.

This didn’t mean there weren’t occasional cases of measles. The disease is active in other countries and can be brought into the U.S. But it was ostensibly eliminated. Unfortunately, the anti-vaccine movement is doing its best to bring measles back. In 2014, there were 644 reported cases of measles and 23 outbreaks, per the CDC. That’s easily the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since 2000, and it was fueled, in part, by the anti-vaccine movement.

This is particularly frustrating since the benefits of vaccinations far outweigh the costs, and much of the anti-vaccine movement is motivated by the misguided belief that the measles vaccination is linked to autism.

This is not true. This misinformation is based on a now-debunked 1998 study that linked autism to the Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine. That study has been declared a fraud. The Institute of Medicine has scientifically studied the issue and said there is no link.

The benefits of the MMR vaccine far outweigh the risks. It’s an incredibly safe vaccine and serious side effects are rare. Whereas between 2001 and 2013, about 28 percent of children younger than 5 with measles had to be taken to a hospital. Measles can lead to death, brain damage and deafness.

And, of course, through the miracle of modern medicine, it’s all avoidable.
