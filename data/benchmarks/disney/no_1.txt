90% of Americans think vaccines for measles are safe: Poll

A new CBS News poll on vaccines in America shows some shifting views on vaccines since the measles outbreak started in Dec. 2014. Concerning the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), nine out of 10 people polled believe vaccines for measles are safe and that itâ€™s not likely linked to autism.

Other aspects of the survey of more than 1,000 adults nationwide reveal that two-thirds of Americans (66 percent) of Americans say parents should be required to vaccinate their children while about the same amount believe children who are not vaccinated should not be allowed to attend public school.

Three-quarters of those polled believe the measles outbreak is very or somewhat serious.

Politically, more Republicans polled believe vaccination of children should be left to the parents discretion (38%) than do Democrats or Independents.

On the topic of vaccine safety, six out of 10 people surveyed believe vaccines are very safe, with younger adults being more skeptical of the safety of vaccines.
