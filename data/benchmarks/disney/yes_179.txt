Vaccine ‘deniers’ should consider source of info

In his March 9 letter, Greg Current implored readers to “remain objective about vaccinations,” but his letter was anything but objective.

He wrote, “To date there has been no study conducted pointing to the effectiveness of vaccines, especially one ... not funded by a pharmaceutical company.”

How patently false! There are hundreds of published studies (double-blind, peer-reviewed) showing the efficacy of vaccines, and many of these were funded without any funding from pharmaceutical firms.

Think about it: Would polio and smallpox have been eradicated if vaccines were ineffective?

For a “balanced perspective,” Mr. Current recommends Dr. Robert S. Mendelsohn’s “How to Raise a Healthy Child ... in Spite of Your Doctor.” I spent time with Dr. Mendelsohn back in the 1970s; he was my girlfriend’s father.

I have read his book and, while it is interesting and passionately written, it is far from balanced. Anyone swayed by Mr. Current’s arguments should consider this: Dr. Mendelsohn died quite prematurely of a skin infection because he refused to take any prescribed medication. The minor infection became fatal when it spread into his bloodstream.

Is this the man whose “balanced” advice you want to take when considering medical matters of life and death?
