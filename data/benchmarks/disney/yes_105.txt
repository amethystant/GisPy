Scrap the religious exemption for vaccination

THE RECENT measles epidemic in the western United States provides a good reminder that it is time to end the religious exemption for vaccination.

Government requires vaccination, not to protect the individual, but to protect the community. What gives me and my family protection is not that I was vaccinated, but that everybody was. However, combine the failure rate of a vaccine with a high enough refusal rate, and the disease can spread.

With all due respect to religion, we need to understand that a religious reason to refuse a vaccine is no reason at all. Imagine if I insisted that my child attend school with a fever during a flu epidemic, claiming religious belief. The claim to a religious exemption for vaccines is no different. It is based simply on belief, or a claim to a belief.

Indeed, we do not accept refusals based on seeing the science differently, or an extreme libertarian point of view, or distrust of government, or a superstitious fear of technology that we don’t understand. These are reasons, at least, but they are judged not good enough. Religious objections count precisely because they come without any reason except a statement of belief, perhaps endorsed by a so-called religious authority.

The alternative is simple and clear. If you want to refuse vaccines and avoid participation in mutual protection of the community, then home-school your children. Don’t send them to where they place my family and community at risk.
