Letter: Do all we can to encourage development of an Ebola vaccine

I write in response to the guest opinion “Greater access to vaccinations will save millions more of the world’s children” (Jan. 5). The public-private partnership Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) is a worthy investment.

Further, we must contain Ebola at its source and also press private companies to develop a vaccine.

A vaccine is the ONLY way to handle this problem. If necessary, we should dangle a sizable "carrot" for the first company to develop a viable vaccine and guarantee to at least cover the costs of the companies that "lose the race." This would encourage a lot of participation if the reward is large and the cost of "not winning" is mitigated.
