Anti-vaxxers, stop using autistic people like me as pawns

The "vaccines cause autism" argument is flawed - so why are so many anti-vaxxers still clinging onto it?

Autism is a mysterious thing.

There's still some debate in the scientific community about what causes it, even if those working in the field have some explanations.

I myself, have autism , and I believe that in my case genetics and a very premature birth perhaps have some role to play.

One thing is sure, however: Vaccines do not cause autism.

There is no serious evidence to prove this fact outside some anecdotes. The controversial research that first linked the two has since been withdrawn from public record .

What is more worrying is how this "Jenny McCarthy" argument seems to be taking hold among a coalition of people who don't vaccinate their children whether for religious or "health" reasons.

Others see the "vaccines cause autism" argument as a way to sue pharmaceutical companies.

Considering that autism is a condition involving multiple challenges for parents, this can be an easy scapegoat for a very complex condition.

But what I find worse is how some crooks are using people with autism as props for their cause.

Vaccines are helping people with autism not contract terrible diseases like measles, polio or the mumps. Because of vaccines, these atrocious diseases are getting rarer and rarer.

Not being vaccinated puts you at higher risk of these terrible conditions that kill more people annually than Ebola.

The anti-vaccine movement is already causing the worst measles outbreak in America in 20 years.

Instead of finding some scapegoat and using autistic people as props, anti-vaxxers should think about what tools autistic people might need to have a better life.

What we donâ€™t need is to listen to charlatans selling snake oil theories.
