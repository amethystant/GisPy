State bracing for measles outbreak

State health officials are preparing for a possible measles outbreak on the heels of a national outbreak.

Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that about 88 percent of Louisiana children younger than age 3 have received the measles vaccine. Michigan and Oregon are the only other states under 90 percent.

Over 120 people from 17 states, including one in Texas, have been infected in recent weeks.

Dr. Frank Welch, state immunization medical director, recommends vaccinating children against measles at ages 1 and 2

Welch said the state conducted six rash illness investigations since a Houston outbreak of measles two years ago and came up with no cases in Louisiana.

“That’s right on the other side of our border,” Welch said. “We’re lucky we haven’t had a case yet.”

According to the state immunization schedule, 14 vaccines should be administered from birth until age 16.

The law also requires that children entering primary school be protected against a range of high-risk diseases including measles, tetanus, polio and pneumonia.

Students don’t have to get immunized if their parents have medical, religious or personal concerns.

Up to 95 percent of primary school children are vaccinated on schedule, but Welch said there is a critical lack of attention to 1- and 2-year-olds.

“Where we fall behind is the period before children enter school,” he said. “Our outreach efforts are focused on getting these children vaccinated on time.”
