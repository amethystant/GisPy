Vaccine exemptions a public threat: Reader

As a family physician, I always look forward to serving as Doctor-of-the-Day for the Mississippi Legislature, courtesy of our Mississippi State Medical Association. However, what I don’t look forward to is if House Bill 130 – allowing a parent or guardian to claim an exemption from a vaccine for conscientious objection or philosophical belief that vaccines cause harm – passes is treating the myriad complications of measles, mumps, rubella, and chicken pox: pneumonia, encephalitis, meningitis, deafness, orchitis, pancreatitis, premature births, eye defects, heart malformations, neurologic problems to name a few.

Mississippi, a leader in protecting its children through vaccination, is one of 31 states which reject philosophical exemptions for children attending school or day care. As a matter of fact, because of recent deadly outbreaks of measles and whooping cough, Washington, Oregon, California, and Vermont (states that allowed philosophical exemptions) have now tightened their exemption rules.

Make no mistake. Deadly diseases still threaten children as well as others around them who cannot be immunized like newborn infants, those with special medical conditions, and older adults at higher risk for complications. Repeated scientific testing has established that immunizations are both safe and effective. It is disingenuous that a group of parents “philosophically opposed” would place at risk an entire generation and thrust us back into the dark ages of medicine.
