Conan O'Brien Takes on Anti-Vaxxers by Putting Kids in Literal Bubbles

On Monday, Conan Oâ€™Brien decided to weigh in on the ongoing debate about vaccinations.

In the wake of the recent measles outbreak, some parents want unvaccinated children to be banned from schools. But Conan has a different solution. Say hello to Kind Hearts Day Care, where vaccinated and unvaccinated kids can learn and play together in harmony. As long as the unvaccinated ones are kept in large plastic bubbles.

Boom. Problem solved. Thanks, Conan!
