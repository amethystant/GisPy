U.S. measles outbreak puts local focus on vaccination

NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (WWLP) – A measles outbreak that started in California has western Massachusetts public health officials stressing the importance of getting vaccinated.

There are at least 141 cases of the measles related to the outbreak at Disney. So far, none in Massachusetts, but the City of Northampton is no stranger to measles. In April of 2014 a Smith College Professor contracted measles on an oversea trip. She did not get her travel vaccinations.

Getting a vaccine is easy. The needles are small. It only takes about three seconds. You only feel a pinch, and you have lifelong immunity. From the flu, to certain strains of cervical cancer, it can all be prevented. But Northampton Public Health Director Merridith O’Leary said some are standing in the way.

“With international travel and this anti vaccine movement, we don’t have herd immunity and we are seeing these infectious diseases making a comeback. They are measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, polio is making its way back,” said O’Leary.

The CDC recommends 49 vaccine doses by age six. Parents told 22News it shouldn’t be optional.

“I don’t think that parents should have the choice, unless there is a really compelling religious reason. This has been one of the most incredible medical advances in the last 100 years,” said Lynne Brill of Florence.

“Even if you think the disease isn’t here anymore, there are people who come here from other places that might have it and can start all over again,” said Debra Wing-Colson of Florence.

Reports of a link between vaccines and autism have been proved false. If your unsure if you’ve been vaccinated for a disease, a simple blood draw will provide the answer.

Vaccines are widely available from your local pharmacy, doctor’s office, and community health department.

A new Quinnipiac University Poll found that voters say 2 to 1 that kids who are not vaccinated should be kept out of school.
