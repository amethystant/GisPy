Safety is the issue for vaccination opponents

The measles outbreak, now moving across the country, has brought mass anxiety over a once common childhood illness. Fear tactics are being used to have parents of unvaccinated children rush to immunize their children.

Did you ever wonder why people choose to avoid vaccinations or the flu shot? It has nothing to do with whether vaccines work and are effective at preventing disease. It has to do with vaccine safety. Despite what you hear from every reporter on the news, vaccines are not 100 percent safe. This fact is irrefutable. Statistics show a certain percentage of children suffer from vaccine injury. Read the information that comes with the vaccine. The list of possible side effects is immense. If vaccines were 100 percent safe, why would our government set up a vaccine injury fund to compensate damaged children?

While severe reactions to vaccines don't affect most children, it is impossible to know which child will have an adverse reaction. This terrible risk is why a growing movement of parents choose not to vaccinate. These parents don't want a real risk of something happening to their children. They would rather risk their child acquiring a childhood illness, which incidentally comes with lifelong immunity that doesn't need booster shots.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 69 doses of 16 vaccines for your child. This number is more than double the vaccines prescribed 30 years ago. If the pharmaceutical industry wants more people to be vaccinated, let's start discussing corporate profits and vaccine safety. Let's not rely on studies that are severely outdated or solely funded by companies that profit from positive reports. Invent vaccines that don't contain harmful additives and chemical fillers that endanger children, such as aluminum, formaldehyde, MSG and mercury.
