Spokane health board member won’t quit in vaccine dispute

SPOKANE — Spokane City Council member Mike Fagan refuses to resign from the county health board over criticism of his statements questioning the safety of vaccines.

Fagan posted on his Facebook page Wednesday the council would have to remove him.

Council President Ben Stuckart told The Spokesman-Review he supports removing Fagan unless he aligns with the health district's position on vaccines. Stuckart had appointed Fagan to the board.

The Spokane Regional Health District recently urged people to make sure they are up to date on the measles vaccine.

Writing on his personal Facebook page last weekend, Fagan questioned the use of vaccines and linked recent outbreaks of contagious disease to illegal immigration.

Other City Council members and others on the 12-member health board have distanced themselves from Fagan's opinions.
