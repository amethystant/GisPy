Vaccinate Before Vacation

RENO, NV - With growing concerns about measles and whooping cough in our schools this year, health officials say getting vaccinated before you travel is more important than ever. In January, 59 cases of measles were linked to contact with an infected person at Disneyland.

Lynnette Bellin of Immunize Nevada says exposure can happen even before you get to your destination. "Any travel, whether it's domestically or international, you're going to be at airports where it's very likely people could be traveling from countries that do not have as strict a vaccine standards as we do," she says.

Most school-aged children are vaccinated, but parents may need to get up to date. If you're unsure of your immunization history, there's a website than can help. It's called Nevada WebIZ (https://izrecord.nv.gov). Using your name, date of birth and social security number, the system will pull up your immunization records. It may even recommend vaccines based on your history.

For college students, Bellin says Hepatitis A and B shots can help protect against food and drink-borne illness. She also recommends meningitis vaccinations for that age group. If you aren't sure about a vaccine you've had in the past, she says there's no danger of "over-vaccination."

"There's a lot of science behind the schedules that we have put together and how our bodies will best work with that schedule so... no, there's no risk of getting too many vaccines at once."

It usually takes about two weeks for a vaccine to be fully effective, but it's not too late to get shots for the upcoming break. If you need information about immunizations or available clinics, check out the links at right.
