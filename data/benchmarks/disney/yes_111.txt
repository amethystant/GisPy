Politics rages unchecked

It will be fascinating to see how New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reacts when pharmaceutical companies produce vaccines for the Ebola virus, which could come as he campaigns next year for the Republican presidential nomination.

Mr. Christie infamously had attempted to quarantine a nurse from Maine who had landed at Newark Liberty International Airport after courageously volunteering to work at an Ebola treatment center in West Africa — even though she did not have Ebola.

But while visiting England this week, Mr. Christie said that vaccination of children against measles, mumps, rubella and other potentially lethal diseases should be somewhat voluntary, even though no one is somewhat infected.

That is an extraordinary view for an educated governor of a highly urban state, where an outbreak of infectious disease could pose a particularly serious challenge.

But there is an outbreak of politics. Mr. Christie often is perceived as being too moderate to appeal to the far-right, anti-science wing of the Republican Party, which has a disproportionate role in the nomination process. So, when that wing’s darling, Sen. Rand Paul, irresponsibly repeated the disproven notion that childhood vaccines cause mental disorders, Mr. Christie had to respond with something.

One would think that public health would be above that level of politics but, apparently, there is no cure.

High-profile politicians like Mr. Christie must stop pandering and insist on promoting the safety, efficacy and mandatory administration of life-saving vaccines.
