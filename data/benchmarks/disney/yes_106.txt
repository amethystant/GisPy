Jimmy Kimmel Unleashes Expletive-Filled Vaccine PSA (Video)

Real (and exasperated) doctors curse up a storm in an attempt to get parents to vaccinate their children.

Jimmy Kimmel delivered a takedown against anti-vaxxers on Thursday’s show and topped it off with a PSA featuring real doctors who are so mad they made the spot into a bleep-fest.

“I cannot f—king believe we have to make this PSA,” said one doctor, while others complained they had to spend their day off making the video instead of binging Breaking Bad.

“Remember the time you got Polio? No! You don’t. Because your parents got you f—king vaccinated,” said another.

The video comes after dozens of people have been exposed to measles in the United States, with anti-vaccination proponents being blamed.
