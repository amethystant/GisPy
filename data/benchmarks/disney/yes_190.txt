HuffPo Exposes the ‘Real’ Anti-Vaccine Stalwarts

In case you thought the sudden uproar over vaccinations wasn’t peculiar enough, Ryan Grim of the Huffington Post offered an even stranger take on who he believes are the persons fomenting skepticism over “settled” science. “[T]he only kind of overlap here,” he explained to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, “is the kind of anti-authority, anti-government, and anti-science bent that you see among a lot of the climate change deniers. You know, that was very much generated and fueled by the Koch brothers.” Sign him up as an aid to Harry Reid! According to the former Senate majority leader, everything – and we mean everything – supposedly wrong with America today is somehow tied to David and Charles Koch. Reid’s fanboys over at the Huffington Post evidently feel the same way. What most conservatives advocate isn’t an outright ban on vaccines as it is a healthy suspicion about what we inject into our bodies. Casting the Right as out of touch with reality is what Democrats are after here.
