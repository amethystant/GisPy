Fagan ignores research

Regarding Steven Neill’s Feb. 27 letter, “Fagan a voice of caution,” which addressed Spokane City Councilman Mike Fagan’s statement that “people have the right to choose to vaccinate or not based on their own research and moral convictions.”

Neill states that Fagan is not saying “not to vaccinate.” No, when a public health board officer says that, he is saying it is OK not to vaccinate. Neill follows with connections to lack of prosecutions on the 2008 financial meltdown; to mandated swine flu vaccines, and to Food and Drug Administration promotion of genetically modified organisms in foods.

In fact, the shell games the bankers did were legal and still are; flu vaccines save lives, even when the virus mutates; the FDA does not promote anything (trust me, having done three trials under FDA guidelines, they are very strict).

Finally, parents can decide “based on their own research”? Concerned parents got 10,000 babies, split into vaccine or no-vaccine groups, and followed them for 50 years? Or, did they go to a website under the search, “Do vaccines cause autism?”

The first Nobel Prize in medicine 114 years ago to Von Behring was for vaccines. Fagan ignores 100 years of proven effectiveness; that does not allow a choice about protecting our children. Vaccinate.
