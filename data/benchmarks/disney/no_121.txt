Family alleges infant died after vaccination

NEW DELHI: A three-month-old child died in south-east Delhi's Jaitpur area on Friday morning after which family members alleged that she fell ill after being vaccinated with anti-rotavirus vaccine. Police have sent the body for postmortem, but no case has been registered.

The child, Iqra, was vaccinated on November 28. On Thursday night the child had a high fever and died on Friday morning. The infant was taken to a local hospital in Khadda colony where doctors suspected a reaction from vaccination. Following this, the parents approached the police. The body was then taken to AIIMS for postmortem.

The child's father Shahabuddin said that the vaccination was done by officials from Centre for Health Research and Development at a camp in the colony.

CHRD officials said that vials of medicine used for vaccination are always tested before being administered. Preliminary examination does not show signs on poisoning which might have led to the infant's death.
