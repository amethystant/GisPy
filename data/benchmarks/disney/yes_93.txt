If you get the flu,it will be more than a 'touch'

Think you might have a touch of the flu?

Think again; if' you've got the flu, it will be more than a "touch.

We've seen social media debates on whether or not to get a flu shot, and while this year's flu vaccine is not very effective -- only 23 percent, on average, more if you're younger, less if you're older -- getting a flu shot is still your best bet.

Officials will be meeting in March to try to decide which flu viruses will be prevalent next year so vaccines can begin to be prepared. With that much time lead, it's easy to see why they don't always make the right guess.

Still, flu vaccines are available, and you should contact your local health department or healthcare provider about getting a shot; it's not too late.

If you're still not convinced, consider this. If you get the flu as a result of not getting a shot, you are endangering everyone around you, including young children, the elderly and medically infirm.

According to the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 45 children have died from the flu this season, including four in the Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska region.

The CDC says 109 children died last year of the flu, a sharp decline from the 171 pediatric deaths reported in the 2013 flu season.

Influenza is not the "stomach flu," but a respiratory virus that results in high fever, extreme chills, joint and body aches, dizziness, coughing and even pneumonia.

Because the vaccine isn't all that effective, it's important to stay on top of any suspected case of flu, treating with antiviral drugs if necessary, within 48 hours of symptoms appearing. There are expected to be enough of the drugs, such as Tamiflu or Relenza, available, although it may take calls to several pharmacies to fill prescriptions.

Meanwhile, to avoid the flu:

* Avoid close contact with sick people, and stay away from others if you are sick.

* Stay home when you are sick, including school and errands.

* Cover your mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.

* Clean your hands, and use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available.

* Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

* Practice other good health habits, such as cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious foods.

Next Memorial Day, after you've taken in the services and decorated graves, stroll around the cemetery and notice the ages of people who died in the years following World War I. Many lives were cut short by influenza -- something that shouldn't be happening needlessly today.
