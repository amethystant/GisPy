Self-report on physical activity, psychological wellbeing, stress and self-rated health may increase the risk of recall-bias. Personal interview is stronger than selfreport in reducing recall bias, and might have prevented the exclusion of participants who had inadequate answers in the IPAQ questionnaire. The drawback is that interview may cause interviewer bias. Prospective diary recording of migraine and co-existing TTH and NP together with personal interview may have been more ideal as diagnostic tools [44].
Detailed history and diary recording are particularly important for ascertaining multiple diagnoses. In the future, a larger sample of participants would allow for separate analyses of those with migraine only and migraine with either co-existing TTH or NP. This would also allow controlling for migraine disability.
There is a risk of losing power when collapsing responses into few categories, however, these categories are more informative and easier to explain to patients.
Migraine and co-existing TTH and NP was highly prevalent in a clinical sample of persons with migraine. Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP reported significantly lower level of physical activity and psychological well-being; higher level of perceived stress, and poorer self-rated health than healthy controls. Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP reported a reduced ability to perform physical activity owing to all three conditions with migraine as the most burdensome condition followed by TTH and NP. Persons with migraine and co-existing TTH and NP may require more focused interventions to increase physical activity. Whether physical activity is a beneficial treatment modality for this group is not known, and should be investigated in a clinical trial.
