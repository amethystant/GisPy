Twelve school systems had comprised the LSES-II population. One additional large system was added to the sampling pool for LSES-III. Nine pairs of schools were chosen using the following procedure:
Within individual school systems, third grade school means on the Total Reading section of the state Basic Skills Test (BST)1 were computed. The BST is administered in late March of each year. Mean scores were developed for both the '82-'83 and '83- '84 school years.
Within each large school system, and among contiguous rural systems, regression models were developed in which mother's education, father's profession, and student body racial composition were independent variables predicting mean BST reading scores. A total of seven separate models were used.
A school was considered for inclusion in LSES-II if a) the school scored above (or below) achievement prediction both years, b) the school scored substantially above (below) prediction at least one year, and c) a matching opposite directional outlier of similar racial composition was identified within that system (or in a contiguous system in the rural models).
