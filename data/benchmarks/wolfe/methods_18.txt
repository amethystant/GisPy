Five participants (2 female; average age 26 years and 5 months) took part in Experiment 1. Two participants had corrected-to-normal vision.
A stimulus display consisting of a pair of identical horizontally oriented black-filled equilateral triangles was presented against a white background with stimuli centred with the reference to the monitor screen (see Figure 4). The area of each triangle was 173 mm2 (side = 20 mm, height = 17.3 mm), with eight equidistant increments from 4 mm to 32 mm between triangles. This led the shortest display to subtend a horizontal visual angle of 3°, and the longest, 5°12′ , from a viewing distance of 80 cm. The vertical visual angle was approximately 1°24′ . The average luminance of the background was 0.0359 cd cm–2 , and the value for the stimulus was 0.00002 cd cm–2 . The experiment was controlled by Superlab experimental software. Experiment 1 and all subsequent experiments were run from a Dell Latitude notebook connected to a 19-inch Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 monitor. The horizontal length of the monitor was 341 mm, and the maximum length of the stimulus in Experiment 1 was 66.6 mm, or under 20% of the overall length. The length of the unused space on each side was 137 mm—over twice the length of the stimulus.
The order of presentation was randomized in advance within four 24-trial blocks using random number tables. There were two levels of aspect (vertex, base) and eight levels of distance (4 to 32 mm), resulting in 16 conditions.
Participants were tested in a sound-attenuated room, with constant low-level ambient illumination provided by a ceiling light. The participants were shown an example of an experimental display (minimum and maximum distance) and were instructed to estimate verbally the distance between the two triangles using the category scaling method, which produces reliable subjective judgment functions (Stevens, 1975, p. 146). Participants were shown examples of the minimum and maximum distance in both configurations (bases and vertices) for 2 s each and instructed as follows:
