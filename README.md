# Gist Implementation in Python
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of gist in Python. 

Based on Fuzzy-trace theory (FTT), when individuals read something, there are two mental representations encoded in parallel in their mind, including gist and verbatim. While verbatim is related to surface-level information in text, gist represents the bottom-meaning and underlying semantics of the text. Inspired by the gist inference score (GIS) introduced by authors of FTT, we try to use text analysis and natural language processing tools to implement and improve GIS in Python. 

Our end goal is to have a metric that gives us an understanding of the potential and capacity of a piece of text in creating a coherent gist representation in people's when they read that text.
