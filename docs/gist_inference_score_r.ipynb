       "1 Hey Gang, Our friend Steve Uesugi, shares this about Benzene, a toxin that creates Cancer is released from heated plastics in your car on a hot day. If your car is in the sun with the windows rolled up. You should roll down the windows and run the A/C for a few minutes to get rid of the Benzene and other toxic off gases released in your car on a hot day.
